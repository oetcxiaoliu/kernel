Rockchip RK3288 LVDS interface
================================

Required properties:
- compatible: "rockchip,rk3288-lvds";

- reg: physical base address of the controller and length
	of memory mapped region.
- clocks: must include clock specifiers corresponding to entries in the
	clock-names property.
- clock-names: must contain "pclk_lvds"

- avdd1v0-supply: regulator phandle for 1.0V analog power
- avdd1v8-supply: regulator phandle for 1.8V analog power
- avdd3v3-supply: regulator phandle for 3.3V analog power

- rockchip,grf: phandle to the general register files syscon
- rockchip,panel: phandle to a panel node as described by
	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/panel/*

- rockchip,data-mapping: should be "vesa" or "jeida",
	This describes how the color bits are laid out in the
	serialized LVDS signal.
- rockchip,data-width : should be <18> or <24>;
- rockchip,output: should be "rgb", "lvds" or "duallvds",
	This describes the output face.

- ports: contain a port node with endpoint definitions as defined in
	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt.

Example:
	lvds: lvds@ff96c000 {
		compatible = "rockchip,rk3288-lvds";
		rockchip,grf = <&grf>;
		reg = <0xff96c000 0x4000>;
		clocks = <&cru PCLK_LVDS_PHY>;
		clock-names = "pclk_lvds";
		avdd1v0-supply = <&vdd10_lcd>;
		avdd1v8-supply = <&vcc18_lcd>;
		avdd3v3-supply = <&vcca_33>;
		rockchip,panel = <&panel>;
		rockchip,data-mapping = "jeida";
		rockchip,data-width = <24>;
		rockchip,output = "rgb";
		ports {
			lvds_in: port {
				#address-cells = <1>;
				#size-cells = <0>;
				lvds_in_vopb: endpoint@0 {
					reg = <0>;
					remote-endpoint = <&vopb_out_lvds>;
				};
				lvds_in_vopl: endpoint@1 {
					reg = <1>;
					remote-endpoint = <&vopl_out_lvds>;
				};
			};
		};
	};
